The new year got us motivated to think about learning a new programming language. Inspired by Alexander Falks’ post “Learn a new programming language this summer” we are opening the learning season 2017: “What programming languages should I learn in 2017?”

It’s one of the most popular questions that gets asked. The only issue with that question is that it’s almost like someone asking what car they should buy.

The answer depends on a lot of things. Do you want new or used? What shape would you like? What specs must it have?

With web development, it follows exactly the same pattern of the car scenario.

Do you want to work for yourself or for a company? How much are you willing to invest on learning? How much time do you have available? What is your current web development knowledge? What is the purpose of you studying programming? Do you prefer backend or frontend?
